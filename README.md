# Password & QR Code Generator

I developed this project to practice Python GUI programming. It is a desktop tool that generates secure passwords and allows you to save them as QR codes.

## What it does
- Generates random passwords with customizable length and complexity.
- Has a graphical user interface (GUI) built with **Tkinter**.
- Can save the generated password as a `.png` QR Code file.
- Allows copying the password to clipboard easily.

## Libraries Used

- **secrets** & **string** (for secure password generation)
- **qrcode** (to create QR images)
- **pyperclip** (for clipboard operations)

## How to Run
